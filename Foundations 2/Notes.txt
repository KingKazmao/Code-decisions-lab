step one -  is planning. (figure out best way to get to what you wanna do, stay organized)

step two - analysis of requirements

Before you build software
- conduct research
- create user personas
- create a prototype
- your idea should solve actual problems for real (potential) users
---------------------------
User research

survey: answer questions on a survey
Interviews: ask live questions and record freeform answers
Observation: watch and learn from peoples natural behaviors
focus groups: Get a group together and facilitate a discussion
contextual inquiry: Blend of observation and interview
usability testing: watch someone use an app prototype
Literature Review: Read existing research on your problem statement and summarize.

Day 4:
 Design


Design Thinking
Is the site usable fo rusers? do they have a good experience? Does the site make users think its truthworthy? is it attractive?


basic design Principles

user experience
User experience is how a perosn feel swhile interacting with a product or interface. The goal is to help users interact with a product that is useful and easy to use resulting in a positive and meaningful experience. 

Usability 
" In large part, what makes something usable is the absence of frustration in using it." - dana chisnell.


- COmmunicate what users should do now
 - if theres a most popular option, draw attention to it
this coul dbe color size placement

- Provide feedback to reward success
 youve completed 2 of 3 steps
 progress bars


 - Hide non critical options unless needed
  can hide options behind modals, dropdowns, mouseovers
 
 - interactivity should be self evident

 - example: is it obvious that lcicking a header sorts the table?
 - would help text/small arrows make this more clear?


TRUST/ CREDIBILITY

Quiet, consistent design promotes a sense of trust/


aesthetic delight


design misconceptions

Its just a step in the process
 its not just one part? its woven throughout?

its easy
- designers make things seem easy because they make things make sense

- its the role of one perosn department
- while there might be individual deisgners or a team of them the work with other teams to help them implement design
into what theyre working on

its a choice

the biggest misconception is that companies have a choice
